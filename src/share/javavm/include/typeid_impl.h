 * A Form, a.k.a. Terse Signature, has two uses:

 * return value and one for each parameter. The encoding we use is the
 * scalar type encoding, with CVM_TYPEID_OBJ standing for all heap types:
 * objects and all arrays.
 * 
 * The lowest-order syllable of the first word is that of the return
 * type.  The syllable ajacent to that is for the first parameter.  The
 * syllable ajacent to that is for the second parameter.  And so on.
 * 
 * Since most signature types have fewer than 7 parameters, most
 * form encodings will fit in one word. These are included in the
 * method signature directly. All that remains are of the bigger
 * type.
 *
 * There are very few forms. They come and go very slowly.

 * there is a fixed-sized part which is kept in segmented arrays, similar
 * to DataTypes. If there are 0<=n<=2 items in the "details" array,
 * they are kept in a small array directly in the object. For n>2,
 * there is a pointer to the array, which is union'ed with the in-line
 * array. This results in no savings in the ROMized case (where we should
 * use sharing of sequence prefixes of detail arrays anyway), but
 * should result in savings for dynamically-created signatures (for which
 * sharing of details is probably too much bother).
 * If the signature is short (nSyllables<=8, i.e. 7 or fewer parameters)
 * then the form is included directly in the signature structure.
 * Otherwise, there is a pointer to one of the above sigForm things.
